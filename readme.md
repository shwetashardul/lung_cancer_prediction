# Lung Cancer Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict lung cancer risk using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patient data and identifying patterns, we aim to provide an early warning system for at-risk individuals, contributing to better outcomes through early detection.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to optimize the dataset for prediction.
- Implementation of machine learning models like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for risk classification.
- Model evaluation and validation to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For all backend processing and machine learning implementation.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing the data and results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You'll also need the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn


### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone <https://github.com/shwetashardul/lung_cancer_prediction>

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages: cd Lung Cancer Prediction


## Usage
To run the prediction model: python lung_cancer_predictor.py

Follow the prompts to input patient data and receive a risk prediction.
